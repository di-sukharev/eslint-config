# eslint-config ðŸŒ»

Here is my eslint + VScode configs.

## Installing

1. If you don't already have a `package.json` file, create one with `npm init`.

2. Then we need to install everything needed by the config:

```
npx install-peerdeps --dev eslint-config-wesbos
```

3. You can see in your package.json there are now a big list of devDependencies.

4. Create a `.eslintrc` file in the root of your project's directory (it should live where package.json does). Your `.eslintrc` file should look like this:

```json
{
  "extends": ["wesbos"]
}
```

Tip: You can alternatively put this object in your `package.json` under the property `"eslintConfig":`. This makes one less file in your project.

5. You can add two scripts to your package.json to lint and/or fix:

```json
"scripts": {
  "lint": "eslint .",
  "lint:fix": "eslint . --fix"
},
```

6. Now we can manually lint code by running `npm run lint` and fix all fixable issues with `npm run lint:fix`. You probably want your editor to do this though, but it can be useful to lint and fix all files at one time.
