# eslint-config ðŸŒ»

Here is my eslint + VScode configs.

## Installing

1. Run command below to install this package and its peerDependencies:

```
npx install-peerdeps --dev eslint-config-sukharev
```

2. Create a `.eslintrc` file in the root of your project's directory (it should live where package.json does). Copy code below into created `.eslintrc` file:

```json
{
  "extends": ["sukharev"]
}
```

3. Have a good time! <3
